# Project Progress

## System Status
Initial documentation phase - establishing project structure and patterns.

## Completed Work
- [x] Basic project structure established
- [x] Core helper modules created:
  - Database connectivity
  - Environment configuration
  - Telegram integration
  - Geolocation services
- [x] Authentication system setup
- [x] Static asset organization
- [x] Apache configuration
- [x] Database setup script created

## In Progress
- [ ] Memory Bank documentation initialization
- [ ] System architecture documentation
- [ ] Component relationship mapping
- [ ] Pattern identification and documentation

## Next Steps
1. Review and document each helper module's implementation details
2. Analyze and document authentication flow
3. Map data flow patterns between components
4. Document external service integration patterns
5. Review security implementations

## Known Issues
To be identified through detailed system review.

## Pending Investigations
1. Helper module implementation details
2. Authentication system security review
3. Database schema analysis
4. External service integration patterns
5. System security audit

## Future Considerations
1. Documentation improvements
2. Code organization optimization
3. Security enhancements
4. Performance optimization
5. Integration testing strategy

## Technical Debt
To be identified through detailed code review.
