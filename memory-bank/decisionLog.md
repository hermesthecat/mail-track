## Historical Architecture Decisions

### Security Architecture
**Context:** Need for comprehensive security model.

**Decision:** Implemented multi-layered security approach:
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Database security measures
- API protection

**Rationale:**
- Protection of sensitive data
- User access control
- System integrity
- API security

**Implementation:**
- Authentication system
- Permission controls
- Data protection
- Security monitoring

### API Design Patterns
**Context:** Need for standardized API interface and data access.

**Decision:** Implemented REST-like API architecture with:
- Endpoint standardization
- Role-based security
- JSON responses
- DataTables integration

**Rationale:**
- Consistent interface
- Clear access patterns
- Standardized responses
- Efficient data handling

**Implementation:**
- Campaign management endpoints
- Statistics endpoints
- Log management
- Email tracking system

### Database Design Patterns
**Context:** Need for scalable and maintainable database structure.

**Decision:** Implemented several key design patterns:
- Timestamp pattern for all tables
- Soft delete pattern for user management
- Counter cache for campaign statistics
- Foreign key relationships for integrity

**Rationale:**
- Ensures data consistency
- Supports scalability
- Maintains referential integrity
- Optimizes performance

**Implementation:**
- Consistent timestamp fields
- Status flags for soft deletes
- Counter fields for statistics
- Foreign key constraints

### Configuration Management
**Context:** Need for secure configuration handling.
